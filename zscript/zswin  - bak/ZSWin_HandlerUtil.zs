		like getting a unique TID.  The number returned is
		not used by any other event handler.
		
		Per the wiki, for inputs, a higher number receives the event first,
		for render events, a higher number receives the event last.
		
		What's not known is what happens if two event handlers share the same order.
		This method is an attempt to give the ZScript Windows handlers unique order
		numbers should other event handlers be present and set order numbers to
		avoid any potential conflicts.
