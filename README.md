# ZScript Windows
![](https://github.com/Saican/ZSWin/blob/master/README/ZSWin_Logo.png)

### Z-Windows is reborn!  ZScript Windows is a full rewrite of the GDCC-based GUI API in ZScript!
 
 #### Notice On Project Language
 - ZScript Windows is written in the (G)ZDoom scripting language called ZScript.  Github is saying the project is written in "ZenScript", which is wrong.  ZScript is a lot like C++.
 
 #### Requirements
 - Version of [(G)ZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads) that supports ZScript version 4.2.1 or higher
 - [Launcher such as ZDL](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL)
 - [Tooltips](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1up3XI8uKaCPuKd57hCXOWIN97f2DEOVH/view?usp=sharing) or [the Repo](https://github.com/Saican/Tooltips)
 - ZScript Windows Package or download the code from here
 
 Load ZScript Windows first and any mod requiring it after.  Tooltips may be loaded anywhere, although it's reccomended it be loaded absolutely first.
 
 #### First Startup
 Go to the Options Menu.  ZScript Windows has it's own settings and one you must personally set - the mouse control toggle.  This is a keybind.  Assign a key you don't already use but is within easy reach.  Other options you may tweak to your liking - it is recommended you leave QuikClose©®ͭͫ set to On.  QuikClose©®ͭͫ allows users to press any of the movement keys to immediately return control to the player; the game does not pause when the mouse is enabled.
