# ZScript Windows
![](https://github.com/Saican/ZSWin/blob/master/README/ZSWin_Logo.png)
 Z-Windows is reborn!  ZScript Windows is a full rewrite of the GDCC-based GUI API in ZScript!
 
 ### Notice On Project Language
 - ZScript Windows is written in the GZDoom scripting language called ZScript.  Github is saying the project is written in "ZenScript", which is wrong.  ZScript is a lot like C++.
