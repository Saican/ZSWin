# ZScript Windows
![](https://github.com/Saican/ZSWin/blob/master/README/ZSWin_Logo.png)

### Z-Windows is reborn!  ZScript Windows is a full rewrite of the GDCC-based GUI API in ZScript!
 
 #### Notice On Project Language
 - ZScript Windows is written in the (G)ZDoom scripting language called ZScript.  Github is saying the project is written in "ZenScript", which is wrong.  ZScript is a lot like C++.
 
 #### Requirements
 - Version of [(G)ZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads) that supports ZScript version 4.2.1 or higher
 - [Launcher such as ZDL](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL)
 - [Tooltips](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1up3XI8uKaCPuKd57hCXOWIN97f2DEOVH/view?usp=sharing) or download the code from [the Repo](https://github.com/Saican/Tooltips)
 - - Check out the [the forum](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=105&t=68495) for usage information
 - ZScript Windows Package or download the code from here
 - - [The ZScript Windows Forum can be found here]()
 
 #### Load Order
 - Tooltips
 - ZScript Windows
 - ...other mods

This isn't necessarily the required load order, but should ensure there are no problems.
 
 #### First Startup
 Go to the Options Menu.  ZScript Windows has it's own settings and one you must personally set - the mouse control toggle.  This is a keybind.  Assign a key you don't already use but is within easy reach.  Other options you may tweak to your liking - it is recommended you leave QuikClose©®ͭͫ set to On.  QuikClose©®ͭͫ allows users to press any of the movement keys to immediately return control to the player; the game does not pause when the mouse is enabled.

 ##### Disclaimer
 - QuikClose©®ͭͫ  is in no way copyrighted, registered, or trade marked.  It's more of a really bad inside joke to just myself because the name is an unintentional mispelling that comes from the original Z-Windows that became the name of the actual system feature.
