# ZScript Windows v0.4.0
![](https://github.com/Saican/ZSWin/blob/master/README/ZSWin_Logo.png)

### Z-Windows is reborn!  ZScript Windows is a full rewrite of the GDCC-based GUI API in ZScript!
 
 #### Notice On Project Language
 - Github doesn't know what it's talking about, this project is written in ZScript, not "ZenScript".
 
 #### Notice On Updates
 - To avoid problems, there will be only one commit to the master branch per day at 12AM - CST, unless otherwise specified, **and so long as there are changes to commit**.
 - This will be done silently, commit or no commit. I do not use social media besides the ZDoom forum and I will not be spamming them with update messages.
 
 #### Requirements
 - Version of [(G)ZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads) that supports ZScript version 4.2.1 or higher
 - [Launcher such as ZDL](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL)
 - [Tooltips](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1up3XI8uKaCPuKd57hCXOWIN97f2DEOVH/view?usp=sharing) or download the code from [the Repo](https://github.com/Saican/Tooltips)
 - - Check out the [the forum](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=105&t=68495) for usage information
 - ZScript Windows Package or download the code from here
 - - [The ZScript Windows Forum can be found here](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=105&t=69630)
 
 #### Load Order
 - Tooltips
 - ZScript Windows
 - ...other mods

This isn't necessarily the required load order, but should ensure there are no problems.
 
 #### First Startup
 Go to the Options Menu.  ZScript Windows has it's own settings and one you must personally set - the mouse control toggle.  This is a keybind.  Assign a key you don't already use but is within easy reach.  Other options you may tweak to your liking - it is recommended you leave QuikClose©®ͭͫ set to On.  QuikClose©®ͭͫ allows users to press any of the movement keys to immediately return control to the player; the game does not pause when the mouse is enabled.
 

**Documentation**
 - Please note that documentation of ZScript Windows is as much a work in progress as the project itself.  If you have question, please feel free to ask them on the forum.

 ##### Disclaimer
 - QuikClose©®ͭͫ  is in no way copyrighted, registered, or trade marked.  It's more of a really bad inside joke to just myself because the name is an unintentional mispelling that comes from the original Z-Windows that became the name of the actual system feature.
