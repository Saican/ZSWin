## Class ZBox : ZObjectBase
### Control for grouping and organizing other controls

------------

#### What happened to ZShapes?
 - ZShapes were a highly ambiguous name and just wrapped too many things into one control to be viable.  So ZBox(es) are just boxes, or groupboxes if considering Windows Forms, ZShapes will be a future feature supporting the ZScript 2D shape class, and lines will be given their own control class as well.
