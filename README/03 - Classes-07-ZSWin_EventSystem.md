## Class ZEventSystem : ZSHandlerUtil
### System Event Handler and UI Processor

------------

#### WHAT?! What's a "ZSHandlerUtil"??!!
Between v0.1 and v0.3 was v0.2.  Ok, yes obviously.  The ZSHandlerUtil class comes from that version because that version featured two event handler, one for logic, one for rendering.  So the system made use of event handler ordering and that process was automated through a method in ZSHandlerUtil called GetLowestPossibleOrder().  Other than that the utility class is just a base class inheriting from EventHandler so the Event System is still an event handler.
