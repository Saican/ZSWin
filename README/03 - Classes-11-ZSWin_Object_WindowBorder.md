## Class ZBorder
### Classic Z-Windows Border Class

------------

#### Classic Z-Windows Drew Windows a Bit Differently
- Basically working around various restrictions, Z-Windows made windows out of nine images; one background, and eight border images.  ZScript Windows isn't restricted to that because it can tile or stretch images, so windows do not have a maximum width or height.  So the original system used to create a window border, using eight additional images, is now a border option when creating a window.

- This class is an internal system class.  Users shouldn't have any need of this class.
