#### How a Linedef Spawns a ZSWindow
- ZScript Windows supports spawning windows through linedef activation in UDMF maps through a set of UDMF user variables.  Use of this method **MUST** be done correctly.  While protections are in place to not cause VM crashes, this method is considered to be extremely taxing on the system.
- **Please report any known abuse of this system.  Please report what game files or provide offending code for analysis.  Preventing misuse of this feature is a high priority.**
